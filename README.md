# Predicting Broadway Weekly Gross Revenue 
In this project, I aim to build a model that will predict a Broadway show’s gross revenue for the week. This model will be mainly useful for investors and producers who wish to predict the earnings of a show on a given week and get an idea of how the show is performing in the industry. This model will also be useful for deciding on the pricing of a ticket, as it will take into account the demand of consumers given a price level. The data used in this model is scraped from Playbill’s website, sourced from The Broadway League (where all data on Broadway are held). The exploration and modeling process reveal that the most helpful features in predicting weekly gross revenue are average ticket price, number of seats in the theatre, number of awards, season, and genre. Having tried 4 different models, the KNN Regression model proves to be the best one.
